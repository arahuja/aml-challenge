[https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2455683](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2455683)

### Challenge 1
Predict which patients will have Complete Remission or become Primary resistant (target column: simp.response)

### Challenge 2
For patients who have complete remission, predict remission duration (length of remission in weeks for patients who achieve complete remission - remission ends if patient dies or relapses)

### Challenge 3
Predict survival time for all patients (life of length in weeks following diagnosis)

## Data
